The character 1
problem
    consider a radioactive decay problem involving two types of nuclei,A and B,with populations NA(t) and NB(t).suppose that
type A nuclei decay to form type B nuclei,which then also decay,according to the differential equations.
Where ta and tb are the decay time constants for each type of nucleus. use the Euler method to solve these coupled equations
for NA and NB as functions of time. This problem can also be solved exactly,as was the case with our original nuclear decay 
problem. Obtain the analytic solutions for NA(t) and NB(t), and compare them with your numerical results, It is also interesting 
to explore the behavior found for different values of the radio ta/tb. In particular,try to interpret the short and long time
behaviors for different values of this ratio. 
    Input the initialize of this radioactive decay problem,such as initial number of nuclei A
Use the Euler approximation to do the calculation.
