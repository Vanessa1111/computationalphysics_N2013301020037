   ! Here is my first vim program.And I spend a lot of time
 to find out how to gei in it.
   ! I'm going to make a program to calculate the quadratic equation.

Just now I wrote a program and I'll write another one at present.
 Why am I so silly to do the repeating work?
Because I do forget to save my program!Damn it!

I'm totally a layman for linux and vim.This afternoon I spent much time learning how to use the system of Ubuntu and how to use the terminal to do something.And it's really uneasy for me,a rookie newbie to do such a thing like contacting with new things.
I wanna cry when I finally used vim  write something because it literally looks so easy and  it isn't for me in fact.
